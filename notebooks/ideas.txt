Ideas to think about:
    - don't recommend outside of established deck colors
        - filter after recommendations are made
    - don't recommend mana only lands (only utility and man lands)
        -filter after recommendations are made
    - display info on deck statistics: cmc distribution, color distrubution
        (see tappedout.net for some ideas)
    - categorize cards by their role, i.e, single target creature removal,
        counterspellst, card advantage, etc.
        - Matt's idea. Quick description of a card, i.e, if the model recommends Lightning Bolt, explain that Lightning Bolt
            is a cheap removal spell




    - store all card images in an s3 bucket, name as 'carstorm_id.jpg'
    - re-scrape everything before final product



TESTING:
    - rank=360 is way too much. It definitely overfitting. It's nice how quickly it picks up on the deck though
    - rank=10 is way too low
    - rank=80 looks okay, not great though. recommends thoughtcast for UW control deck (weird)
    - rank=160 looks pretty good. finds delver deck
