Ideas to think about:
    - consider cmc in the recommendations. recommend less higher cmc cards
    - don't recommend outside of established deck colors
    - don't recommend mana only lands (only utility and man lands)
    - display info on deck statistics: cmc distribution, color distrubution
        (see tappedout.net for some ideas)
    - categorize cards by their role, i.e, single target creature removal,
        counterspellst, card advantage, etc.
    - be able to upload deck lists in text format
