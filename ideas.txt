Ideas to think about:
    - consider cmc in the recommendations. recommend less higher cmc cards
        - this may be taken care of automatically by the recommender. If other decks don't play many high cmc cards,
            it won't recommend high cmc cards.
    - don't recommend outside of established deck colors
        - filter after recommendations are made
    - don't recommend mana only lands (only utility and man lands)
        -filter after recommendations are made
    - display info on deck statistics: cmc distribution, color distrubution
        (see tappedout.net for some ideas)
    - categorize cards by their role, i.e, single target creature removal,
        counterspellst, card advantage, etc.
        - Matt's idea. Quick description of a card, i.e, if the model recommends Lightning Bolt, explain that Lightning Bolt
            is a cheap removal spell
    - be able to upload deck lists in text format
    
    
    - Update training decks weekly, maybe monday or tuesday night? Most events are on the weekend
